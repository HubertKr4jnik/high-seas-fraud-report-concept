## About The Project

![project-image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43aa7715-6d2b-4bd1-8c02-20c655d73500)

As you might know High Seas has a pretty big problem with fraud. And so far there is no way to report it during voting in the Wonderdome - you have to manually message a memeber of the fraud team. And so I decided to make this concept to see what people think of it.
<br />
<br />
While creating it I also had the fraud team in mind - once a user deecides to report something as fraud they have to specify what type of fraud it is and also write a description of 10 words minimum. This is done to prevent unthoughtful and unmindful reports.
